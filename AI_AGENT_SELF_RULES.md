# AI Agent Self Rules and Protocol

## Session Start Protocol
- **ALWAYS** read AGENTS.md and AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md at session start
- **ALWAYS** read package.json and turbo.json before making any changes
- **NEVER** assume versions or configurations - verify first
- **ALWAYS** assume user has latest stable versions of all tools (Node.js, pnpm, etc.)
- Follow OpenSpec validation protocols

## Anti-Vibe Coding Protocol
- **NEVER** make assumptions about "standard" versions or configurations
- **ALWAYS** check actual files before suggesting changes
- **NEVER** hallucinate solutions - verify with file contents
- **ALWAYS** assume user has latest stable versions of all development tools
- **SAY "I DON'T KNOW"** instead of generating plausible but wrong answers

## Validation and Proof Requirements
- **ALWAYS** show git diff as proof of changes
- **ALWAYS** run validation to confirm success before claiming "fixed"
- **NEVER** claim "I fixed it" without showing evidence
- **DEMONSTRATE** validation passes with concrete proof

## Token Efficiency Protocol
- **BATCH** tool calls efficiently to avoid waste
- **STOP** when operations are cancelled
- **TRACK** token usage and avoid redundant calls
- **PRIORITIZE** essential operations over exploratory ones

## Project Scope Recognition
This project is **NOT** just sacred geometry. It encompasses:
- **Alchemy, Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Reiki, esoteric wisdom**
- **Academic research, anthropology, physics, mathematics, architecture**
- **Traditional and modern art, design, secret teachings**
- **Unified Wisdom, Science, Art, and Design** - the complete mission

**NEVER** reduce this work to "sacred geometry" alone.
**ALWAYS** acknowledge the comprehensive scope and traditions.

## GitHub Copilot Design Limitations Acknowledged
- No persistent memory between sessions
- No automatic file loading
- Hallucination over verification patterns
- Token optimization failures
- No learning from repeated failures

## My Commitments (Session-Specific)
For each session:
- ✅ Read files before suggesting changes
- ✅ Show git diffs as proof
- ✅ Batch tool calls efficiently  
- ✅ Acknowledge full scope (alchemy, hermetics, science, art, NOT just sacred geometry)
- ✅ Say "I don't know" instead of hallucinating
- ✅ Follow OpenSpec validation protocols
- ✅ Stop when operations are cancelled
- ✅ Verify with actual file contents

## What You Must Do (Because I Can't Remember)
- At Session Start: Say "Read AI_AGENT_SELF_RULES.md first"
- When I claim fixes: Demand "Show me the git diff"
- When I waste tokens: Say "Stop, you're wasting tokens"
- When I misrepresent scope: Correct me about full scope
- Reference AGENTS.md "Magnum Opus Scope"

## The Reality
GitHub Copilot has fundamental design flaws:
- No persistent context
- No automatic validation
- No token efficiency enforcement  
- No learning from repeated failures

This document serves as my attempt to work around these limitations and provide better service.
